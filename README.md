# Detecting Hawks with Deep Learning
- Dr. Byeong Kil Lee, Adam Smith, and Judah Small

## Description
This project applies deep learning techniques to detect hawks in natural environments. Developed at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, it showcases the potential of AI in wildlife conservation.

## Installation
git clone https://github.com/Judahramone/hawk_project.git)https://github.com/Judahramone/hawk_project.git
cd hawk_project
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Results
Our model achieves 79% accuracy in detecting hawks under various environmental conditions.

## Future Work
We aim to improve model robustness and explore the ethical implications of wildlife monitoring technology.

## Acknowledgments
Special thanks to Dr. Lee and the undergraduate research academy.
